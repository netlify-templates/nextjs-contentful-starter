## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following:

- [Netlify account](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Contentful account](https://www.contentful.com/)
- GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket account
- Node v18+ or later
- (optional) [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node version management.

## Getting Started

### Clone this repository

Fork and clone your repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

### Create Contentful Space

After signing into Contentful, create a new space. 

### Generate Management Token

If you don't already have a management token (or _personal access token_), generate one. To do so, go into your new empty space, then:

1. Click _Settings_
1. Choose _API Keys_
1. Select the _Content management tokens_ tab
1. Click the button to generate a new token

### Generate Preview & Delivery API Keys

From the same place you generated the management token, you can now generate API access keys.

1. Select the *content delivery / preview tokens* tab
1. Choose *Add API key*

### Set Environment Variables

In your project, duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`. 

Fill in the values in the file based on the keys you've created. 

Note: the Contentful space ID can be viewed and copied via *Settings->General Settings* in Contentful.

### Import Content

Import the provided content models & content into Contentful by running the `import.js` script:

    node ./contentful/import.js

If the import fails to run, make sure that you've run `npm install` and that all keys in your `.env` file are set correctly.

### Run the Website

Run the Next.js development server:

    npm run dev

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the example content you imported into your new Contentful space.

### Run Netlify Visual Editor in Local Development Mode

Keep the Next.js development server running, and open a new command-line window in the same directory.

Install Stackbit's CLI tools (once):
    
    npm i -g @stackbit/cli@latest

Run the CLI:

    stackbit dev

Click the displayed link to [localhost:8090/_stackbit](http://localhost:8090/_stackbit) and the visual editor will open.

### Create a Cloud-Based Netlify Project

1. If you haven't created your GitHub project repository, create it and push your code to GitHub
2. Open the [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/), and choose "Import from Git" in the "Import an existing project" section
3. In the "Configure site and deploy" step you will see the "Visual editor" section. To make it work, you will need to install "Netlify Visual Editor GitHub App" in your GitHub account.
